a.Actions undertaken from the design feedback.

The cards a play has has been all contained in the "PlayerCards" class. The player cards class holds a list of stacks that hold references to the cards. 
This has the advantage that all the cards owned by a play can be easily searched in the single container.

To avoid code repetition "shufflable" and "sortable" stacks are of type stack with only the extra methods added to the class 


b.The completeness of the solution.

I would say the solution is incomplete. The solution is sufficiently dry. There is no code repetition in the current solution. 

c.The advantages and limitations of object-oriented design patterns.
